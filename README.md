# Server's API

Supported REST endpoints:

```
 DELETE  /tasks/{id} 
 GET     /tasks
 GET     /tasks/{id}
 POST    /tasks
```
    
To create new task POST on ```http://localhost:9000/tasks``` with json body looks like this:
```javascript
{"description":"blibli"}
```
will create new task, The response will contain the same task with the id generated by the server
(be aware to add the Content-Type: application/json to the http request)


To get all tasks GET on ```http://localhost:9000/tasks```, returns list of tasks formated in json, for example:
```javascript
[{"id":10,"description":"blibli"},{"id":2,"description":"blabla2"},{"id":4,"description":"blabla2"},{"id":5,"description":"blabladrggdfdfgdf"},{"id":6,"description":"kuku"},{"id":7,"description":"blabladfdfd"},{"id":8,"description":"kuku"},{"id":9,"description":"blabla2"}]
```

To delete a task DELETE on ```http://localhost:9000/tasks/{id}``` {id} should be the task id you would like to delete

You can also get single task using GET on ```http://localhost:9000/tasks/{id}```
